This directory houses several static databases, which are to be
periodically updated by a cron-run script. These databases are used,
if available, to provide a richer navigation experience in the public
site.

For instance, though the public site rooted at /html does not use PHP
at all---and is thus very fast and stable---we want to use PHP
specifically for some 404 pages (certainly /html/sailors/404.php). The
reason is that if the URL used 'mit' instead of 'MIT', we can redirect
the user to the correct URL using the correct error code. This is even
more impressive (and useful) if the user writes 'harvard' instead of
'HAR'.

We want this functionality, however, without the overhead of
connecting to the MySQL database that ultimately houses this
information.  We regard this utility as a luxury of our system, and
can safely tolerate some stale data, which is why serializing as XML
files in this directory is a welcome compromise. Furthermore,
considering that data about schools is apt to not change very
frequently, this should be no problem at all.

At least as of creation, the files (or tables) that will exist here
are 'schools.db' and possibly 'sailors.db'.
