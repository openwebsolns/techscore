Migrating to XML Library

Since the current XmlLibrary and the future HtmlLib have different
names for the analogous classes (the latter being prefixed with an
'X'), the best course of action is to migrate each element at a time,
changing the name and its use from one library to another.

During that migration, both libraries will be loaded into memory, but
the program will use the class that it can.

This means, however, that the new library will have to be modified to
temporarily allow anything that has a toXML or printXML (as in duck
typing). Futhermore, this means that the first course of action is to
add the new methods to the XmlLibrary.
