* Explain tiebreakers (d o n e)

* Inactive editing panes (d o n e)
- Create menu at the TScorePage level, since the menu is always to be
   displayed the same way except that inactive pages would be grayed
   out. Note that dialogs are always to be displayed.

* Preferences API for users
- Timezone settings
- Stylesheet to use

* Dialog CSS, etc (d o n e)

* Javascript COOKIE (d o n e)

* Access keys (d o n e)

* FIX CSS Table Styles (d o n e)

- Both CSS positioning and placement within page

** Schools

For each school, provide a summary of regattas participated in and
average overall place finish among finished regattas.

Provide a list of current regattas participating in.

Provide a link to the collegesailing.info information page for that
school.

* PUBLIC side: display results on a "weekend" basis

** Season page: organize by each weekend

Play off regattas that have not been finalized by not displaying the
winning burgees.

** Home page: latest weekend, and other seasons, and others


** Conference

Each conference page will show be organized as follows:

  1. Conference summary:
     a. Number of regattas (this season)
     b. Winningest team
     c. Winningest sailor?

  2. Current sailing regattas


* Move scoring side to ts.hostname VirtualHost? (d o n e)
 

* Migrate to using WebServer class for redirects (d o n e)
 
* Specify regatta types as constants (d o n e)

* Fix rotation pane, again! (d o n e)

* A third update type perhaps: RP (d o n e)

RP updates would affect the score and the rotation pages, but not
the season summary, while affecting the school summary. Just a
thought.

Also a fourth one, called 'sync' when the regatta is finalized?

* Why are there "errors" when submitting RP? (d o n e)

* When syncing (d o n e)...

The num_races is the total number of races planned for in the system
for that regatta. The 'status' field delimits either the last race
sailed if ongoing, 'Pending' if already 'over' (due to time or all
races sailed), or 'Final' if finalized.

* Bring the update school script to the new data tables (d o n e)

This means using dt_regatta, etc.


* Make score updates happen in one giant query of awesomeness (d o n e)!

Perhaps as big as one race full at a time? Also, and perhaps more
importantly, attempt to update scores intelligently: that is, do not
rescore races which have no penalty or breakdowns.

Also, consider merging breakdowns penalties and finish into one
awesomer table.

** Deprecate the finish listener interface

Instead, use the Regatta::setFinishes method to do your bidding.
