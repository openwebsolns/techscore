* Season administrative interface

Now that seasons are required for regattas to be created, we should
create the appropriate admin interface for this to happen.


* Team racing

Here's a wacky idea! Team racing uses three divisions and a "combined
racing" ambience (but with a different scoring mechanism). Nope, that
does not make sense.

Except that it does! What if a team racing regatta's "races" were
other "mini"-regattas with 3-divisions using combined division scoring
and two of the teams from the parent team racing regatta?

This leads me to believe that the true order of things when creating a
regatta should be details, then teams, then races. This must specially
be the case for team-racing regattas.

Except that two paragraphs ago does not make sense either due to the
complexity it would add to the current state of affairs. So here's a
new idea:

A team scoring regatta is secretly a three-division combined scoring
regatta where only two teams participate in each race (and the others
get an appropriate DNS).

A new linking table (tr_race_teams) indicates which teams participate
in which race. Cool, huh?

** DetailsPane

It occurs to me that users probably are not allowed to change the
regatta type scoring to/away from Team after finishes have been
entered.
