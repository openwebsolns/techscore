The md5sum file, if present, should indicate the md5sum of all the
files in the lib/ directory. This allows the Daemon
(lib/scripts/Daemon.php) to check if the source has changed since it
started running; and if so, kill itself in order to load the new
version.

This file may be created by running Make, which should be a hook to
the version control system. If not present, then the file will not be
checked by the Daemon processes, which must then be manually restarted
with code changes.
