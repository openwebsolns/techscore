TechScore is the official regatta scoring platform of the
Intercollegiate Sailing Association (ICSA).

The goal of this program is to provide a centralized database of all
the scores and participation for all the fleet racing regattas
organized under ICSA. In addition, it provides a graphical user
interface for scoring these regattas.

TechScore does not maintain membership information; this comes from
ICSA directly. It does, however, track the performance of all its
sailors, and provides some reporting facilities.

The web program is a PHP application which connects to a database
(most cases MySQL). It includes two front-ends: the scoring site which
is dynamic in nature, and a public site that consists of static XHTML
pages with all the scores for all the regattas, among other pieces of
information.

TechScore is a full-system solution, meant to be deployed under a
UNIX-like system, utilizing mainstays like cron and (GNU)Make.
