<h4>January 27, 2011 Test</h4>
<p>As a result of the test carried out on January 27, we have
  finished making substantial improvements to the site. Among these
  is a more responsive experience all around, particularly when
  creating new rotations.</p>

<p>Other bug fixes include creating offset rotations correctly,
  handling of RP errors, better communication in error messages, and
  other backend fixes.</p>

<h4>Official release of Version 2.0!</h4>
<p>This new version of TechScore provides great improvements over
  previous versions, including a move to a permanent server for
