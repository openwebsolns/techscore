<p>The following is a list of frequently asked questions when
  creating rotations.</p>
<dl>
  <dd>What is displace finishes?</dd>
  <dt>
    When entering a breakdown by assigning a particular score, the
    scorer has the option to specify whether the newly entered finish
    bumps other finishers back. By default, this
    is <strong>not</strong> the case. This means that two boats can
    get the same score for the same race.

  <dt>
    Please note that this option is not available if the team is
    assigned average score as a breakdown.

  <dd>What should I use for penalties?</dd>
  <dt>
    The procedural rules specify that all penalties are scored
    as <strong>FLEET + 1</strong>. This is what is meant by the
    &quot;Use standard scoring&quot; option. This is the default and
    should be used most of the time. Note that this always
    results in other teams being bumped <strong>forward</strong> by
    one place.
  </dt>
  <dt>In the rarest of cases, and for flexibility reasons, in keeping
  with the procedural rules which enable a judge to assign a score as
  he/she sees fit, the scorer has the opportunity to assign a
  particular score as part of the penalty. In such cases, the scorer
  also gets to choose whether to push the other finishes behind the
  newly assigned score, or to assign the penalty without affecting
  other finishes.</dt>
