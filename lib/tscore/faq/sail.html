<p>The following is a list of frequently asked questions when
  creating rotations.</p>
<dl>
  <dd>How can I change the order of the divisions?</dd>
  <dt>When creating rotations, TechScore uses the order in which the
    divisions were created. Usually, the divisions are created in order
    (A, B). In this case, the divisions will appear in that order under
    the <em>Division(s)</em> heading. If you want to create a rotation
    where B division starts first, go back to the <em>Races</em> page,
    remove the divisions, and create B division first.</dt>

  <dd>What's a <em>Copy-cat</em> rotation style?</dd>
  <dt>The rotation is created for the first of the chosen divisions,
    and then copied team for team, sail for sail, to the other
    divisions.</dt>
  
  <dd>What's <em>Franny</em> style?</dd>
  <dt>The rotation is created for the first of the chosen divisions,
    and then offset by a fixed amount for the subsequent
    divisions. The offset amount equals the total number of boats
    divided by the number of divisions.</dt>
