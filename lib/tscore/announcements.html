  <em>October 8, 2009</em>: Several changes were implemented to
  improve and streamline the user experience. Some of the new features
  include:
  <ul>
    <li>Creating rotations in any division order.</li>
    <li>Expanded main menu for easier navigation and more intuitive
      interaction.</li>
    <li>Disabled the weather reporting feature due to lack of
      interest. Race conditions are no longer stored for each
      race.</li>
    <li>More prominent feedback/announcement mechanism.</li>
    <li>Short FAQ on creating rotations.</li>
  </ul>

<p>
  <strong>TechScore</strong> is a new regatta scoring system for
  <a href="http://www.collegesailing.org">CollegeSailing.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
  It extends the traditional scoring methods to bring all the data
  from all the collegiate regattas into one central database,
  allowing in the process real-time around-the-world update of
  ongoing regattas as well as past regattas. More information soon!
  <em>This program is still under development</em>.
